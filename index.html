    <h2> About Me:</h2>
    <img src="Profile.JPG" alt="Profile photo">
    <p>I am a passionate learner going into STEM looking for opportunities
      with Information Technology (IT), Computer Software Engineering (CSE),
      and Computer Engineering (CE). While finding these opportunities,
      I hope to enhance my communication skills and view a new mindset. </p>

<section id="resume">
  <p>Although my skills are quite lacking in terms of work experience and
    technology skills, I am willing to learn and communicate through training
    and multitasking. Some skills that I am most knowledgeable are:</p>
  <div class="grid-container">
    <div class="box box1">Office 365</div>
      <p>I am fully capable of using and teaching the use of the applications
        like OneNote, Outlook, Teams, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and other
        Microsoft applications upon request.</p>
    <div class="box box2">Java</div>
    <p>After taking two Java courses in my career path, although I am
      not fully capable of handling advanced Java projects, I can
      help implement and look over any Java code for feedback or
      explanation. </p>
    <div class="box box3">HTML & CSS</div>
    <p>As of July 2024 to end of December 2024, I am continuing to learn
      about HTML and CSS, however, if you feel like my creation of this website
      is nice and formatted correctly enough, then I am more than capable
      to build a website for any company.</p>
    <div class="box box4">Building & Cleaning PCs</div>
    <p>I am very passionate about computers, especially what components
      are in each and every computer. From Macs to PCs, I can build and clean your
      device.</p>
